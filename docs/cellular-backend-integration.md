# Cellular Backend Integration Design

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive backend integration design for cellular configuration management. The system uses JSON-based data persistence and structured API endpoints to handle all cellular operations.

## Architecture

### Data File Structure
- **Location**: `ur-webif-api/data/cellular_config_data.json`
- **Purpose**: Central data store for all cellular configuration and status information
- **Format**: Structured JSON with sections for status, configuration, networks, profiles, and history

### Backend Components

#### 1. CellularDataManager Class
- **Purpose**: Utility class for managing cellular data operations
- **Functions**: Load, save, validate, and manipulate cellular configuration data
- **Benefits**: Centralized data management, consistent file operations, validation

#### 2. WirelessRouter Cellular Handlers
- **Status Handler**: Returns current cellular status from JSON data
- **Config Handler**: Manages configuration read/write operations
- **Connect/Disconnect**: Updates connection state in data file
- **Scan Handler**: Returns available networks from data
- **Events Handler**: Processes frontend events and updates data accordingly

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/cellular/status
- **Purpose**: Retrieve current cellular status
- **Data Source**: `cellular_status` section in JSON file
- **Response**: Complete status information including signal, connection, SIM details

### GET /api/cellular/config
- **Purpose**: Retrieve current configuration
- **Data Source**: `cellular_configuration` section in JSON file
- **Response**: All configuration parameters (APN, auth, preferences)

### POST /api/cellular/config
- **Purpose**: Update cellular configuration
- **Action**: Merges new config with existing data and saves to file
- **Response**: Success confirmation with applied configuration

### POST /api/cellular/connect
- **Purpose**: Initiate cellular connection
- **Action**: Updates connection status in data file
- **Response**: Connection initiation confirmation

### POST /api/cellular/disconnect
- **Purpose**: Disconnect cellular connection
- **Action**: Sets disconnected status and clears connection data
- **Response**: Disconnection confirmation

### POST /api/cellular/scan
- **Purpose**: Scan for available cellular networks
- **Data Source**: `available_networks` and `scan_results` sections
- **Response**: List of available networks with signal information

### POST /api/cellular/events
- **Purpose**: Process frontend interaction events
- **Action**: Updates data based on event type and action
- **Response**: Event processing confirmation

## Data Sections

### cellular_status
Complete real-time status information including:
- Connection state and status
- Signal strength and quality metrics
- Network information (name, technology, band)
- SIM card details (IMSI, ICCID, status)
- Device information (IMEI, model, firmware)
- Data usage and connection time

### cellular_configuration
User-configurable settings:
- APN settings (name, username, password)
- Network preferences (type, selection)
- Connection options (auto-connect, roaming)
- Data limits and authentication

### available_networks
Scanned network results:
- Operator information
- Network IDs and technology
- Signal strength measurements
- Availability status

### connection_profiles
Saved connection configurations:
- Profile metadata (ID, name, dates)
- Connection parameters per profile
- Usage tracking

### data_usage_history
Historical usage data:
- Daily usage breakdown
- Upload/download statistics
- Trend analysis data

### supported_features
System capabilities:
- Supported technologies and standards
- Available authentication methods
- Network type options

## Frontend Integration

### Data Flow
1. Frontend makes HTTP request to cellular endpoint
2. Backend loads data from JSON file using CellularDataManager
3. Data is processed and mapped to response format
4. Frontend receives structured JSON response
5. UI updates based on received data

### Event Handling
1. User interactions trigger events via /api/cellular/events
2. Backend processes event type and associated data
3. Relevant sections of JSON data are updated
4. Response confirms successful processing
5. Frontend can refresh data to reflect changes

### Error Handling
- File operation errors fall back to default data
- JSON parsing errors return structured error responses
- Missing data sections are handled gracefully
- Configuration validation prevents invalid states

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- Centralized data management through CellularDataManager
- Clear separation between data operations and API handling
- Consistent error handling and logging

### Flexibility
- Easy to modify data structure by updating JSON file
- New fields can be added without code changes
- Configuration profiles support multiple connection scenarios

### Testing
- Data can be easily modified for testing scenarios
- JSON structure allows for comprehensive test data sets
- Backend behavior can be tested independently

### Scalability
- Data file approach scales for development and testing
- Easy migration path to database backend
- Structured API design supports future enhancements

## Implementation Notes

### File Operations
- Data directory is created automatically if missing
- File locks prevent concurrent modification issues
- Backup and recovery mechanisms can be added

### Performance
- JSON file is loaded on demand, not cached globally
- File operations are optimized for small data sizes
- Memory usage is minimized through efficient data handling

### Security
- Sensitive data (passwords) can be encrypted in storage
- Access controls can be added at the file system level
- Audit logging tracks all configuration changes

This design provides a robust foundation for cellular configuration management with clear data contracts between frontend and backend components.
